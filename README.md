# PropelR

### A web application built for shopping malls / complexes using deep leaning model for visitor analytics to understand visitor count and demographic profile.

#### Deep leaning models are used to detect persons coming through entry gate and people moving through corridors on different floors of the mall.

### The detected persons are then passed through age, gender and emotion model to derive these information. This is a cloud based solution hosted on AWS cloud for data processing. The edge device is used to capture the camera frames and post motion detection passed to AWS based server for further processing.
